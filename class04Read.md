## React Docs - Forms 

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’? 

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why

- we should wait to store the users responses from the form into state  to make some input validation 

### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- event.target.value


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained ?

- it will do the same as a normal if statment but less lines will make our code more readable and cleaner

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```
```
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
```
