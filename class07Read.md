## REST

### Who is Roy Fielding?
-  lot about what those things point to in that research I was talking about. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern
